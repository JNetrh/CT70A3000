###Standard Calculator:
⋅⋅*External Inputs: do calculations – such as numbers, convert units
⋅⋅*External Outputs: no external outputs
⋅⋅*Logical internal files: none – we cannot store the data in external outputs
⋅⋅*Logical interface files: none – it is stateless. It does not remember anything
⋅⋅*External Enquiries: none – it has no connection to other External enquiries
Total functionality is: `(2 x 4) + (0 x 5) + (0 x 10) + (0 x 7) + (0 x 4) = 8`
It is very little number but as it is obvious, the calculator is very simple program with a few functionalities. 

###Notepad:
⋅⋅*External Inputs: It allows to write a text, 
⋅⋅*External Outputs: There con not be done any reports or views.
⋅⋅*Logical internaů files: we can save the text into a file,
⋅⋅*Logical interface files: browse the system file system – it can search many files witch various extensions, but we cannot open them. 
⋅⋅*External Enquiries: we can search highlighted word or phrase in Bing search engine, can get a time from system, 
Total functionality is: `(1 x 4) + (1 x 5) + (1 x 10) + (1 x 7) + (2 x 4) = 46`

### Firefox browser:
⋅⋅*External Inputs: Display internet pages, display source-code of the web.
⋅⋅*External Outputs: send notification when a certain activity happen, 
⋅⋅*Logical internal files: 7
⋅⋅*Logical interface files: extension, walk through FTP server, Images downloaded from the web
⋅⋅*External Enquiries: HTTP methods – gaining data from HTTP/FTP servers.
Total functionality is: `(2 x 4) + (1 x 5) + (7 x 10) + (3 x 7) + (1 x 4) = 108`
According to stored data: There is huge amount of data stored by the browser. All can be found at official Mozilla support. So Local interface files is a great number. It would influence the final number a lot so let estimate there is about 7 local internal files.
